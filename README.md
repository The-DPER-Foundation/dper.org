# Digital Public Education Resources - DPER.org 
Powered by the public for a more educated world.

# What is DPER?
DPER is a free digital resource promoting the empowerment of the public through accessible education.
This goal is acheived through the hosting, publishing, creation, and curation of educational/informational media.
Our philosophy is that knowledge is an inalienable right to all, regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual preference, nationality, etc.
Everyone deserves the chance to be informed and learn in an environment that is comfortable to them.
